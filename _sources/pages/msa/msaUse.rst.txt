Install the Matching Service Adapter
======================================

**Prerequisite:** The Matching Service Adapter requires Java 8. Make sure you have the latest version of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed. 

1. When you have successfully completed a gate review for `Stage 3: Planning <http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage3/Stage3.html>`_, email `idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk <mailto:idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>`_ to request access to the secure site where you can download the Matching Service Adapter.

2. Download the Matching Service Adapter to your host. It contains:

 * a jar (java archive) file 
 * a :ref:`truststore <gloss_truststore>` file and a metadata truststore file for non-production environments (the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment) 
 * a truststore file and a metadata truststore file for the production environment


3. To extract the files and move the truststore files to the environment where you want to use the Matching Service Adapter, run the following commands::

    tar -xf [filename].tar.gz
    unzip ida-msa-[xxx].zip
    mv prod_ida_truststore.ts prod_ida_metadata_truststore.ts [path to truststore directory in the production environment]
    mv test_ida_truststore.ts test_ida_metadata_truststore.ts [path to truststore directory in the integration environment]

 where:

 * ``[filename]`` is the name of the tar file
 * ``[xxx]`` is the build number
 * ``[path to truststore directory...]`` is the location of the truststore – you specify this when configuring the Matching Service Adapter (see the configuration options ``storeUri:`` and ``trustStorePath:`` in the :ref:`YAML file <yamlfile>`)


Versioning
-----------

Typically, GOV.UK Verify releases a new version of the Matching Service Adapter every 2 or 3 months. Some releases are essential updates, and we may remove support for older versions. To keep updated, contact the `GOV.UK Verify support team <mailto:idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>`_ to ensure you are on the Matching Service Adapter email distribution list.


.. _msa_certs:

Obtain certificates for your Matching Service Adapter
=======================================================
Your Matching Service Adapter needs a signing certificate and an encryption certificate. You must use different certificates for each environment.

To obtain certificates: 

* :ref:`generate self-signed certificates <samlCTselfsigncert>` for use with the compliance tool
* :ref:`request certificates <pkiRequestCert>` from the IDAP certificate authority for the integration and production environments


.. _ConfigureMSA:

Configure the Matching Service Adapter
==============================================

Create a YAML configuration file 
-------------------------------------

When you :ref:`start the Matching Service Adapter <msa_test_msa>`, you need to supply a YAML configuration file. 

Create a YAML configuration file based on the example below. Then :ref:`adapt it <msa_adapt_YAML>` for the SAML compliance tool or appropriate environment.

.. _msa_adapt_YAML:

Adapt the YAML configuration file
------------------------------------

Make the following changes to the YAML configuration file. Variations are indicated where appropriate for the SAML compliance tool and integration and production environments. 


1. Enter port numbers for the server application and admin ports.

 .. note:: If the Matching Service Adapter will be handling SSL termination (typically this will be handled by a proxy/load balancer like HAProxy), or if you don't trust the network between the SSL termination endpoint and the Matching Service Adapter, then specify ``https`` rather than ``http`` for the type of connection. For more information, see the guidance in the `DropWizard configuration manual <http://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/0.8.2/docs/manual/configuration.html#https>`_.

2. Enter the URIs for your matching service and Matching Service Adapter in ``matchingServiceUri:`` and ``matchingServiceAdapterLocation:`` respectively.

3. If you're creating new user accounts when a match is not found (see :ref:`ms_cua`), enter the user account creation URI in ``unknownUserCreationServiceUri:``

4. In ``entity id``, enter the entityID for the Matching Service Adapter in URI format. You create your own URI, possibly to reflect the name of your service, for example: ``https://<service name>/MSA``

 .. note:: It's good practice to use the Matching Service Adapter's URI (i.e. the URI where the hub will send Matching Requests) as its entity ID, but this isn't mandatory.

5. In ``metadata:``, use the ``uri:`` parameter to specify the location where the Matching Service Adapter accesses the SAML metadata:

  * for the SAML compliance tool, your GOV.UK Verify engagement lead will give you the URL

  * for the integration environment, enter: ``https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation``

  * for the production environment, enter: ``https://www.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation``

6. In ``metadata:``, use the ``trustStorePath:`` parameter to specify the path to your metadata truststore for the appropriate environment:

  * for the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment, use ``test_metadata_truststore.ts``

  * for the production environment, use ``prod_metadata_truststore.ts``

7. In ``clientTrustStoreConfiguration:``, use the ``storeUri`` parameter to specify the path of your general truststore for the appropriate environment: 

  * for the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment, use ``test_ida_truststore.ts``

  * for the production environment, use ``prod_ida_truststore.ts``

8. Enter the paths of the SAML signing and encryption private keys for your Matching Service Adapter:

 * ``privateSigningKeyConfiguration:`` – PKCS#8 DER formatted

 * ``privateEncryptionKeyConfiguration:`` – PKCS#8 DER formatted

 .. note:: To convert a private key to PKCS#8 DER format, run the following command: ``openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in server.key -out server.pk8 -outform DER``

 For the compliance tool, :ref:`generate self-signed certificates <samlCTselfsigncert>`.

 You will use different keys and certificates for the integration and production environments. See :ref:`pkiRequestCert`.

9. Enter the paths and names of the SAML signing and encryption certificates for your Matching Service Adapter.  The names are used to identify the certificates in the metadata so should be meaningful and unique:  ``signing_1`` and ``encryption_1`` would be acceptable.

 * ``publicSigningKeyConfiguration:`` – public signing certificate, PEM formatted
 * ``publicEncryptionKeyConfiguration:`` – public encryption certificate, PEM formatted

10. If you want to use Graphite software to monitor the Matching Service Adapter’s performance (optional), supply the required metrics: type, host, port, prefix and frequency of the reporter.


.. _msa_test_msa:

Start the Matching Service Adapter
==============================================

To start using the Matching Service Adapter, run the following command, supplying the path to your configuration file:

::

 java -jar [filename].jar server [path to configuration file].yml

You can now run :ref:`SAML compliance tests between the hub and your Matching Service Adapter <samlCThubMSA>`. To help :ref:`build your local matching service <msBuild>`, you can use the :ref:`example of the JSON request <samlCT_JSONeg>` that the Matching Service Adapter posts to your service. 



Monitoring 
============

Health checks run every 60 seconds to ensure that the Matching Service Adapter is functioning correctly. They test:

* connectivity
* that the Matching Service Adapter accepts the hub signature
* that the hub accepts the Matching Service Adapter signature


Configure HTTPS Proxies
==================================

The Matching Service Adapter supports HTTP and HTTPS proxies configured by Java properties. 

For information on configuring HTTPS proxies, see `http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html>`_.


Secure your Matching Service Adapter
=======================================

Matching Service Adapter TLS certificates
-------------------------------------------

GOV.UK Verify trusts the following root certificate authorities for HTTPS connections to your matching service:

+----------------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Root certificate authority | Common name               | X509v3 subject key identifier                               |
+============================+===========================+=============================================================+
| AddTrust External CA Root  | AddTrust External CA Root | AD:BD:98:7A:34:B4:26:F7:FA:C4:26:54:EF:03:BD:E0:24:CB:54:1A |
+----------------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| GeoTrust Global CA         | GeoTrust Global CA        | C0:7A:98:68:8D:89:FB:AB:05:64:0C:11:7D:AA:7D:65:B8:CA:CC:4E |
+----------------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| QuoVadis Root CA 2         | QuoVadis Root CA 2        | 1A:84:62:BC:48:4C:33:25:04:D4:EE:D0:F6:03:C4:19:46:D1:94:6B |
+----------------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

If you want to use a root certificate authority for your matching service that isn’t in the above table, raise a ticket with us by sending an email to idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk. We’ll review your chosen root certificate authority before adding it to this list.

When you raise a ticket, indicate the chain of trust with your SSL/TLS certificate. You will also need the chain of trust when you configure your server. 


Connect your Matching Service Adapter to the internet securely
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Your Matching Service Adapter must only respond to matching requests from the GOV.UK Verify hub, otherwise there’s a risk of user data being compromised.

The Matching Service Adapter checks that matching service requests are genuine by checking their cryptographic signatures.


To ensure that only the GOV.UK Verify hub can access the Matching Service Adapter, make sure your Matching Service Adapter:

* is only exposed as HTTPS endpoints 
* only uses strong recent versions of TLS (for example TLS 1.2); turn off obsolete and insecure versions (for example SSLv1, SSLv2, and SSLv3)
* supports multiple strong cipher suites

  .. note:: GOV.UK Verify will remove support for TLS cipher suites if serious weaknesses become known. Having multiple suites provides resilience. 

* allows requests and health checks only from the IP addresses of hub services provided by your engagement lead 

  .. note:: Each Matching Service Adapter should communicate with only 1 hub service (SAML compliance tool, integration environment, or production environment).
