How a PKI works 
=================

Public keys, private keys, and certificates
----------------------------------------------

To encrypt and sign data, you need 2 pairs of keys:

* public and private **encryption** keys
* public and private **signing** keys


The keys consist of very long numbers linked in a particular way so the public key can be derived from the private key but not the other way around. Entities within a PKI generate their own keys. They always retain their private keys. However, they share their public keys with other entities to allow secure communication through :ref:`encryption <pki_encrypt_cert>` and :ref:`signing <pki_sign_cert>`.

Public keys are shared using certificates. A certificate is a file that contains: 

* a copy of the certificate owner's public key
* information about the identity of the certificate owner
* an indication of the purpose of the certificate, for example, encryption or signing

Certificates are issued and signed by a certificate authority. The certificate authority acts as the root of trust in the PKI. An entity that receives data from a third party can request confirmation from the certificate authority that the third party's certificate is valid.

Keys and certificates in the GOV.UK Verify federation
--------------------------------------------------------

The IDAP PKI and GOV.UK Verify federation use the X509 standard for digital certificates. 

In the GOV.UK Verify federation, the IDAP certificate authority issues and signs certificates. As a government service using GOV.UK Verify, you need to request 4 certificates: 

* encryption and signing certificates for your service
* encryption and signing certificates for your Matching Service Adapter


To obtain a certificate:

#. Generate pair of keys (:ref:`private <pki_gen_private_key>` and :ref:`public <pki_gen_csr>`). You must generate a pair of encryption keys for each encryption certificate request and a pair of signing keys for each signing certificate request.
#. :ref:`Submit a certificate signing request <pki_submit_csr>` to the IDAP certificate authority. 
#. The certificate authority generates your certificate and sends it to you.

    Request certificates

The certificate authority also issues certificates for the GOV.UK Verify hub and identity providers. 

.. _pki_encrypt_signing:

Data encryption and signing
----------------------------

.. _pki_encrypt_cert:

Encryption certificates provide the sender with assurance that only the intended receiver can decrypt the message.

The sender extracts the public encryption key from the receiver's encryption certificate and uses it to encrypt a message. The receiver decrypts the message using their corresponding private encryption key.

      Example of data encryption

.. _pki_sign_cert:

Signing certificates provide the receiver with assurance of who authored the message. They also guarantee that the message hasn't been tampered with since the author signed it.

When signing data, you use your private signing key to create a digital signature, and then send the signed message. The receivers check the digital signature using your public signing key from your signing certificate.

     Example of data signing

You can use encryption and signing together or alone. For example:

 **Signing alone**

  When a user indicates that they would like to verify their identity, the government service sends a message to the :ref:`hub <hub>`. The message is unencrypted because it contains no personal user information. However, the message is signed because the hub needs assurance that the message originated from the government service.

 **Encryption and signing**

  When a user has verified their identity, the identity provider sends a signed message to the hub containing the user's encrypted personal information. This ensures the confidentiality of the message and its origin.  

A message can contain embedded messages which may be encrypted and/or signed by different entities within the GOV.UK Verify federation. For more information, see the :ref:`diagram showing the SAML message flow <samlWorks>` within the GOV.UK Verify federation.
