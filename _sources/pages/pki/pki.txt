Public Key Infrastructure
==========================

The purpose of a :ref:`public key infrastructure <gloss_pki>` (PKI) is to implement secure electronic transactions over insecure networks such as the internet. A PKI is used to authenticate identities for the purposes of data encryption and signing:

* encryption - scrambles the data in a way that makes it unreadable except to intended recipients
* signing - proves who authored the data and guarantees that it hasn't been tampered with since

Encryption and signing are provided by public-key cryptography. A PKI supports public-key cryptography by assuring the identities of the entities that encrypt and sign data. It does this by issuing digital certificates. A PKI is therefore used to set up and maintain a network of trusted entities and services. This means that when you send encrypted data you can be certain that only the intended recipient can decrypt it and that when you receive signed data you can be certain who authored it.

.. rubric:: **Why does GOV.UK Verify use a PKI?**

The  Identity Assurance Programme (IDAP) runs a PKI to enable secure communication between the entities in the GOV.UK Verify federation, for example, between government services and the GOV.UK Verify :ref:`hub <hub>`.

The entities in the GOV.UK Verify federation communicate with each other using :ref:`Security Assertion Markup Language <saml>` (SAML). Public-key cryptography secures the integrity and privacy of SAML messages sent between the different entities. 

.. rubric:: **What do you need to do?**

As part of the GOV.UK Verify federation you need to :ref:`request certificates <pkiRequestCert>` from the IDAP PKI certificate authority. When your certificates are due to expire you need to run the :ref:`key rotation process <pkiRotate>` to update the keys in your certificates. 

You are responsible for ensuring that the terms of the IDAP PKI Certification Policy are upheld. To do this, you and your service manager need to refer to a set of documents. Your service manager must request these documents from the IDAP PKI:

* 'Certification Practice Statement for the Interim PKI for the IDAP Ecosystem' - sets out the practices governing cryptographic services for the IDAP federation
* 'IDAP PKI Subscriber Agreement' - sets out the terms of use of PKI for those using certificates received from the IDAP PKI
* 'IDAP PKI Relying Party Agreement' - sets out the terms for those who do not necessarily hold a certificate, but who, during the course of a transaction, may be a recipient of a certificate and place reliance on a certificate and/or digital signatures created using that certificate 
* 'GOV.UK Verify Certification Process for (Relying Party) Subscribers' - indicates the URLs where you can submit certificate requests to the IDAP certificate authority
