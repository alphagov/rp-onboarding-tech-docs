Request access to environments
===============================

To access the integration and production environments, fill in the 'Request access to an environment' form. Your GOV.UK Verify engagement lead provides this form subject to successful gate reviews. You'll access the integration environment during `Stage 4 <http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage4/Stage4.html>`_  and the production environment during `Stage 5 <http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage5/Stage5.html>`_.

.. note:: Please allow up to 5 working days for the GOV.UK Verify team to set up and configure access to an environment.

Before filling in the form, you must :ref:`obtain signed certificates <pkiRequestCert>` from the appropriate certificate authority.

First select the environment you want to access: integration or production. If you're requesting access to the production environment, you need to fill in the entire form. Information from your integration environment is not carried over. 

Fill in the form as indicated below:

1. **Service entityID** 

  Enter the entityID for the service you want to connect to the integration environment. This is a globally unique identifier for your service within the environment. It's typically in URL format, for example \https://identity.service.gov.uk. If you have more than 1 service connected to the environment, make sure each has a unique entityID.

  .. note:: This field must be unique for each connection you request for the integration or production environment. 

2. **Matching service entityID**

  Your matching service is a unique entity within the federation. It therefore needs an entityID, which must be different from your service entityID. For example \https://identity.service-ms.gov.uk. Several services can use the same matching service.

3. **Matching service URL** 

  Enter the fully qualified URL to which the hub will make matching service requests. For example \https://identity.service-integration.gov.uk/msa.

4. **Service start page URL**

  Enter the fully qualified URL used to access your service. This is usually a page on GOV.UK, for example \https://www.gov.uk/update-company-car-details.

5. **Assertion consumer service HTTPS URL**

  Enter the fully qualified URL to which the hub will send its responses. For example \https://test-rp.service.signin.gov.uk/authentication_endpoint.

  .. note:: This field must be unique for each connection you request for the integration or production environment. 

6. **Service signature validation certificate** 

  Upload a valid X509 certificate signed by either the IDAP test certificate authority or the IDAP certificate authority. This certificate validates the digital signature present on all messages sent from your service. It must correspond to the private key for your service. See :ref:`pkiRequestCert`.

7. **Matching service signature validation certificate** 

  Upload a valid X509 certificate signed by either the IDAP test certificate authority or the IDAP certificate authority. This certificate validates the digital signature present on all responses sent from the Matching Service Adapter. It must correspond to the private key for the Matching Service Adapter. You can retrieve the certificate from your Matching Service Adapter by accessing: /matching-service/SAML2/metadata. See :ref:`pkiRequestCert`.


8. **Service encryption certificate**

 Upload a valid X509 certificate signed by either the IDAP test certificate authority or the IDAP certificate authority. The hub uses this certificate to encrypt the assertions within the responses that it sends to your service. Your service decrypts the assertions using your corresponding private key. See :ref:`pkiRequestCert`.

9. **Matching service encryption certificate** 

  Upload a valid X509 certificate signed by either the IDAP test certificate authority or the IDAP certificate authority. The hub uses this certificate to encrypt the assertions within the requests that it sends to the Matching Service Adapter. The Matching Service Adapter decrypts the the assertions using the corresponding private key. You can retrieve this certificate from your Matching Service Adapter by accessing: /matching-service/SAML2/metadata. See :ref:`pkiRequestCert`.

10. **Requested cycle 3 attribute name** 

  Enter the name of the additional information you want the hub to send for :ref:`matching cycle 3<ms_mc3>`, for example, driving licence number. Matching cycle 3 is used if :ref:`matching cycle 1<ms_mc1>` fails. Make sure that your GOV.UK Verify engagement lead pre-approves this field as it requires development.

  .. note:: If you've made a special arrangement with your GOV.UK Verify engagement lead, enter **previously arranged** in this field.

11. **Matching service user account creation URL**
 
  Enter the fully qualified URL to which the hub will make unknown user attribute query requests. This is optional. It is required only if you want to enable :ref:`user account creation<ms_cua>` in your service.

12. **Attributes for creating user account** 

 This applies if you have implemented :ref:`user account creation<ms_cua>` in your service. Select the attributes you want the hub to send back to your service:

    * ``FIRST_NAME``
    * ``MIDDLE_NAME``
    * ``SURNAME``
    * ``DATE_OF_BIRTH``
    * ``CURRENT_ADDRESS``
    * ``CYCLE_3``

Your content designer can provide the remaining information:
 
13. **Service display name** 

  Enter the service name that appears to the user throughout their hub journey. Use a sentence starting with a verb, for example *Sign in to your personal tax account*, rather than a title like *Self Assessment tax return*.

14. **Other ways to... display name** 

  Enter an alternative service name, for example *access your personal tax account*. This appears on the *Other ways to...* content in the hub, which appears when a user can't prove their identity using GOV.UK Verify. If you don't provide an alternative service name, the GOV.UK Verify team sets it to the service display name by default. 

15. **Other ways to complete the transaction** 

  Enter valid HTML content, including URLs, that displays on the *Other ways to...* content in the hub. This informs the user of alternative methods of using your service. For example: *If you can’t verify your identity using GOV.UK Verify, request Government Gateway user ID and password replacements from HMRC. This can take about 10 working days (or longer if you live abroad). For help, contact the HMRC Online Self Assessment helpline.*
