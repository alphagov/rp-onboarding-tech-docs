.. _samlIntegrationtool:


Use extended validation certificates
-------------------------------------

You should use extended validation (EV) certificates for all public interactions with your service. This will protect your users from fraudulent sites imitating your service.

You should also follow recommendations from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to keep your service secure, including  `using TLS to protect data <https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/tls-external-facing-services>`_.


.. _ChooseProductFramework:

Use the Verify Service Provider
--------------------------------------

Your service must be able to send SAML authentication requests to, and receive SAML responses from, the GOV.UK Verify hub.

The `Verify Service Provider <https://github.com/alphagov/verify-service-provider>`_ handles the SAML communications between your service and GOV.UK Verify Hub.

This means that if you're using the Verify Service Provider, you don't need to be familiar with SAML to use GOV.UK Verify in your service. Your team only needs to manage JSON.

Using Verify Service Provider will make it easier to:

* connect multiple services with GOV.UK Verify - you only need one instance of Verify Service Provider

* handle certificate rotations - you can host multiple certificates at a time

You will need to host Verify Service Provider on your own infrastructure.

If you are unable to use the Verify Service Provider, it is still possible, although not recommended, to use an off-the-shelf product or to build your own custom interface to integrate your service with GOV.UK Verify. Have a look at the `Government Service Design Manual <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html>`_ and use the most appropriate products and frameworks for your team.

Contact your engagement lead if you need further information.

.. _saml_access_metadata:


Connect your service to the Matching Service Adapter metadata
----------------------------------------------------------------

To integrate GOV.UK Verify into your service, you need to connect your service to the Matching Service Adapter (MSA) metadata.


The MSA metadata:

* indicates the URL where your service will send users with their authentication requests - this is the GOV.UK Verify hub

* lists one or more MSA signing certificates, so your service can validate messages that are sent by your MSA

* describes the MSA as an identity provider




The MSA metadata is located in your MSA at /matching-service/SAML2/metadata

Your service must poll the MSA metadata every 10 minutes.

Send a SAML authentication request to the GOV.UK Verify hub
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Use your chosen :ref:`product and framework <ChooseProductFramework>` to build a SAML authentication request in XML:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <saml2p:AuthnRequest ...>
        <saml2:Issuer xmlns:saml2="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion" Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity">http://www.test-rp.gov.uk/SAML2/MD</saml2:Issuer>

        </ds:Signature>
      </saml2p:AuthnRequest>


2. Send the authentication request to the URL indicated in the element ``SingleSignonService`` in the MSA metadata.


.. _saml_handle_responses:

Handle SAML responses using SAML metadata
----------------------------------------------------------------

To consume SAML responses that are issued by the GOV.UK Verify hub:

1. Decrypt the assertion.

2. Validate the signature on the assertion contained in the response. This assertion is generated and signed by your MSA.

   You can use the X509 signing certificate contained in the MSA metadata to validate this signature.

.. caution:: Use this procedure with care. You must trust assertions signed by the MSA only. The GOV.UK Verify hub never issues assertions for consumption by the service endpoint, so make sure that itâ€™s *not* possible to trust the hub to issue assertions.
