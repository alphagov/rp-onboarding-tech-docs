.. _generateSelfSignedCertificates:

Generate self-signed certificates
=================================

.. warning:: This documentation is out of date. We have published `new technical documentation <https://www.docs.verify.service.gov.uk>`_.

To communicate with GOV.UK Verify you need to use keys and certificates. If you're communicating with the GOV.UK Verify hub, your certificates
must be :ref:`issued by the IDAP certificate authority <pkiRequestCert>`. If you're communicating with the compliance tool, generate self-signed certificates as described here.

Generate self-signed certificates with OpenSSL
-------------------------------------------------

You can generate keys and self-signed certificates in whatever way is most convenient and familiar for you. There are many different formats of keys and certificates. The Matching Service Adapter (MSA) uses PKCS#8 formatted keys (.pk8) and PEM encoded X509 certificates (.crt).

The GOV.UK Verify team generally use the OpenSSL tool to do this using the guidance from the `Heroku Dev Center <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self#prerequisites>`_.


Install OpenSSL if it isn't already installed:

* OS X (with homebrew) - ``brew install openssl``
* Windows - download the 'Complete package, except sources' from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm
* Ubuntu Linux - ``apt-get install openssl``

Run the following commands in order, replacing:

* ``$name`` with the filename of the key or certificate you're generating - see :ref:`Keys and certificates for your MSA<KeysandCertsforMSA>` and :ref:`Keys and certificates for your service<KeysandCertsforService>`
* ``$commonName`` with a description of how the certificate will be used - for example 'My Service MSA Signing Primary'

    # Generate a private key:
    openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out "$name.pass.key" 2048
    openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in "$name.pass.key" -out "$name.key"

    # Generate a certificate signing request (CSR):
    openssl req -batch -new -subj "/CN=$commonName" -key "$name.key" -out "$name.csr"

    # Generate a self signed certificate:
    openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in "$name.csr" -signkey "$name.key" -out "$name.crt"

    # Convert the private key to .pk8 format:
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in "$name.key" -out "$name.pk8" -nocrypt

    # Clean up the files you donâ€™t need anymore:
    rm "$name.pass.key"
    rm "$name.csr"
    rm "$name.key"


.. _KeysandCertsforMSA:

Keys and certificates for your MSA
---------------------------------------

With the default configuration in ``test-config.yml`` the MSA needs the following keys and certificates:

* ``test_primary_signing{.pk8,.crt}`` - primary signing private key and certificate
* ``test_secondary_signing{.pk8,.crt}`` - secondary signing private key and certificate
* ``test_msa_encryption_1{.pk8,.crt}`` - primary encryption private key and certificate
* ``test_msa_encryption_2{.pk8,.crt}`` - secondary encryption private key and certificate

.. Note:: The MSA needs primary and secondary keys to support :ref:`key rotations <pkiRotate>` without causing service downtime for users.

.. _KeysandCertsforService:

Keys and certificates for your service
--------------------------------------------

Your service must sign SAML messages and decrypt assertions, so at a minimum you need a private key and certificate
for each of these roles. Your service should support multiple encryption keys :ref:`to allow for key rotations <pkiRotate>`.

Depending on how your service is built you may need to provide keys and certificates in a different format, for example .jks or .pem.
