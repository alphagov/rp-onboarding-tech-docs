Create user accounts
===============================

You can create a new user account for the user based on the :ref:`hashed persistent identifier <gloss_hashpid>` (PID) and a subset of attributes from the :ref:`matching dataset <gloss_mds>`. It's optional to set up your matching service to support the creation of user accounts.

.. important:: Before creating a user account you must request explicit user consent. 

Prerequisites
--------------------------------------

1.	Configure your MSA to create user accounts. To do this, supply the local matching service's account creation URI in ``accountCreationUrl:`` in the :ref:`YAML configuration file <ConfigureMSA>`.

2. On the ':ref:`Request access to an environment <envRequestform>`' form, enter the fully qualified URL to which the hub will make unknown user attribute query requests.

3. On the ':ref:`Request access to an environment <envRequestform>`' form, enter the list of attributes you want the hub to return to your service when creating new user accounts. The options are:

.. _list_cua_attributes:


  ::

   FIRST_NAME
   FIRST_NAME_VERIFIED
   MIDDLE_NAME
   MIDDLE_NAME_VERIFIED
   SURNAME
   SURNAME_VERIFIED
   DATE_OF_BIRTH
   DATE_OF_BIRTH_VERIFIED
   CURRENT_ADDRESS
   CURRENT_ADDRESS_VERIFIED
   ADDRESS_HISTORY
   CYCLE_3

  .. note:: You can't use historical data other than address history to create user accounts. For example, you can't use an out of date surname to create a new user account.

Message flow
--------------------------------------

This diagram shows the message flow for creating user accounts. In this example, the service has been set up to create user accounts when matching fails.

   ".. figure:: createanaccount.svg
     :alt: Diagram showing user account creation. The MSA converts between SAML and JSON. The MSA contains a fully qualified URL to which the hub makes unknown user attribute query requests. The text below the image describes the steps.

     User account creation","For more details, see the diagrams:

   * :ref:`GOV.UK Verify architecture <arch>`
   * :ref:`SAML message flow <samlflow_diagram>`
   * :ref:`matching cycles <ms_matchcyles_diagram>`" 

.. note:: In this example, all 3 :ref:`matching cycles <ms_matchcycles>` previously failed to find a match for the user in the government service records. See the :ref:`diagram for matching cycles <ms_matchcyles_diagram>`.

1.	Your local matching service sends a ``no-match`` response to the hub via the MSA.
2.	The GOV.UK Verify hub:

  * checks that your matching service supports the creation of user accounts 
  * identifies the attributes you previously said your service needs to create a user account

3. If your service supports the creation of user accounts, the hub sends a query to the MSA. It contains the:

  * :ref:`matching dataset <gloss_mds>`
  * :ref:`hashed PID <gloss_hashpid>`
  * :ref:`level of assurance <gloss_loa>` 
  * list of attributes to extract from the matching dataset

4. The MSA POSTs the following JSON to the local matching service's account creation URI endpoint: 

  ::

   [{
    "hashedPid": "<string value>",
    "levelOfAssurance": "<the level of assurance, e.g. LEVEL_1>"
   }]

5. Optionally, the local matching service stores the hashed PID and level of assurance in the local matching datastore. 

   You'll need to create a correlation between the user account and the hashed PID, so a returning user can match with :ref:`cycle 0 <ms_mc0>`. You can choose to store the hashed PID at this point and create a correlation between the user account and the hashed PID at step 9. Alternatively, you can create the user account, store the hashed PID and set up the correlation at step 9.

6. The local matching service sends a JSON response to the MSA:


   ::

     { "result": "success" }

   or

   ::

     { "result": "failure" }

  .. note:: As shown above, ``success`` and ``failure`` must be in lower case. 

  .. note:: A user account isn't created at this point. The final response the hub sends to your service will contain the attributes you need to create a user account. 

  The local matching service may return ``{ "result": "failure" }`` if:

  * the level of assurance in the JSON request sent by the MSA is lower than the level of assurance required by the service
  * there are exceptional circumstances, such as maintenance, when you want to suspend user account creation

7. The MSA extracts the required attributes from the matching dataset. 

8. The MSA sends the extracted attributes, the hashed PID and the level of assurance to your service via the GOV.UK Verify hub.

  .. note:: The MSA must send this data via the GOV.UK Verify hub, to respect the following identity assurance principles:

    * user control - users must give informed consent for their information to be used to create an account; they must also be allowed to check their information before you create the account
    * data minimisation â€“ the service receives only the restricted set of attributes it needs, not the full matching dataset. 

    For more information see the `Identity Assurance Principles <https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/draft-identity-assurance-principles/privacy-and-consumer-advisory-group-draft-identity-assurance-principles#the-nine-identity-assurance-principles>`_.

9. The government service:

   * creates a user account using the attributes extracted from the matching dataset
   * sets up a correlation between the user account and the user's hashed PID

  .. important:: If you create a user account you must gain consent from the user first.
